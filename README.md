# JavaScript-Challenge: Password Generator
Description: This week’s Challenge was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected.
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. 

### Acceptance Criteria 
I was tasked to ensure the following:

1. When a user clicks the button to generate a password they are prompted with the following password criteria:
- Password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 chracters
- Lowercase, uppercase, number, and/or special characters.
2. When all prompts are answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
3. The password is either displayed in an alert of written to the page
